Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms plain text into beautiful static websites. It's perfect for blogs because:

- **Simple** - No database required
- **Fast** - Static files load quickly
- **Secure** - No server-side vulnerabilities
- **Free hosting** - GitHub Pages hosts Jekyll sites for free

## What to Expect

I'll be sharing my thoughts on various topics including:

1. Technology and programming
2. Personal projects
3. Tutorials and how-to guides
4. And much more!

## Code Examples

Jekyll supports syntax highlighting out of the box:

```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, World!"
end
```

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Stay Tuned

Thanks for visiting! Make sure to check back for new posts.
